# Signal-Android

I changed some details in the code of the original Signal-Android-App.

The Changes are til now:
- It doesn't use the Google Play Services during the Registration
- The color in the Chat is different (not white)
- The color in the Chatlist is different (not white)
- There are lines between the chats in the Chatlist
